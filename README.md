# My Portfolio Website

Visit <a href="https://www.erineagloria.com/">My Portfolio Website</a>

## Project Summary 
For my final project with General Assembly I decided to make my own portfolio website using React Class Components. 
The final product is a responsive mobile-first front-end application. A back-end was not required. 

Accessibility on the web is important to me. I have done my best to incorporate accessible features whilst doing my best to showcase my personality and incorporate my own style. 

## Technologies used:
* Whimsical (mobile first wireframes)
* Asana (to make to-do lists)
* React.JS 
* JavaScript
* React Router 
* React Smooth Scroll 
* React-Spring (animation)
* Material-UI
* React Vertical Timeline
* Material.IO
* HTML5
* CSS
* Github pages (to host my website)
* Surge.sh (initially used to host my website, but later changed the host to Github)
* NameCheap.com (for my custom domain and email)

## App Features:

** Need to change below - still text from old project ** 

The website includes 4 main sections: 
- Introduction/Landing Page 
- About
- Projects
- Contact

## Planning Process

### Improvements:
* ✔ After doing some reflection, I need to replace the lorem ipsums in the 'About' section with specific details 
* Revise the size of the project images so that the bigger the page, the smaller the gap between the project and text 
* ✔ Once finalised, update my pdf resume 
* Revise the nav bar so that it does not cut off the headings of each component
* Incorporate React Spring to flip the background of my introduction page
