For my final project I decided to make my own portfolio website. 

This is a front-end application - no back end was required. 

## Project Summary 

My portfolio website is made in React.JS......

## Technologies used:
* Whimsical (mobile first wireframes)
* Asana (to make to-do lists)
* React.JS 
* JavaScript
* React Router 
* React-Scroll, 
* React-Spring (animation)
* Material-UI
* React Vertical Timline
* Material.IO
* HTML5
* CSS
* Surge.sh (to host my website)

## App Features:

** Need to change below - still text from old project ** 

loopd is built for existing clients. Upon loading the website the user will be asked to enter their login details(company name & password) right away. The app is designed so that a client will be provided login details from the business, they will not be able to sign up for an account. 

Below the login details there is a feed of previous events that have taken place for inspiration. When the images are when clicked it will give a few event details. The client will be anonymous of course!

Upon logging in, the user will have access to their dashboard with a record of their events listed in order with the latest/upcoming events at the top and the oldest events at the bottom. Clients can submit and delete a request to host a new event. They can update details of their upcoming events. They can also add notes/feedback to previous events; however, all other details will be locked. 

The app will allow them to draw inspiration from other clients' events and keep a record of their events with our business. 

## Planning Process

### Improvements:
* Add details to the 'About' section
* Revise the size of the project images so that the bigger the page, the smaller the gap between the project and text
* Once finalised, update my pdf resume
* Revise the nav bar so that it does not cut off the headings of each component
* Incorporate React Spring to flip the background of my introduction page
