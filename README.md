# My Portfolio Website

## Project Summary 
For my final project with General Assembly I decided to make my own portfolio website using React Class Components. 
<br>
The final product is a responsive mobile-first front-end application. A back-end was not required. 

Accessibility on the web is important to me. I have done my best to incorporate accessible features whilst trying to showcase my personality and style on the website. 

## Technologies used:
* Whimsical (mobile first wireframes)
* Asana (to make to-do lists)
* React.JS 
* JavaScript
* React Router 
* React Smooth Scroll 
* React-Spring (animation)
* Material-UI
* React Vertical Timeline
* Material.IO
* HTML5
* CSS
* Github pages (to host my website)
* Surge.sh (initially used to host my website, but later changed the host to Github)
* NameCheap.com (for my custom domain and email)

## Website Inclusions & Features:

The website is made up of 4 sections: 
- Introduction/Landing Page 
- About
- Projects
- Contact

Features include: 
* Custom domain name and email 
* Responsive mobile-first application
* Designed with acccessiblity in mind (ie. alt text, aria labels, colour considerations, using words instead of images on buttons/links, use of headers to structure content, descriptive names)
* Single page application with React smooth scroll feature to direct users to specific parts of the website
* Dynamic vertical timeline feature that adjusts to the size of the screen (large screen - two columns, mobile - one column)
* Animations to underline important text (different sections and email)
* Clickable images to view each project, short descriptions including the tech stack used and login details (if required), links to the code 
* Link to view & download my latest resume
* Mailto email feature linked to my custom email, which is redirected to my gmail account
* Secured website (website is hosted on Github pages which includes 'Enforced HTTPS') 

## Planning Process

### Improvements:
* ✔ After doing some reflection, I need to replace the lorem ipsums in the 'About' section with specific details 
* Revise the size of the project images so that the bigger the page, the smaller the gap between the project and text 
* ✔ Once finalised, update my pdf resume 
* ✔ Revise the nav bar so that it does not cut off the headings of each component
* Incorporate React Spring to flip the background of my introduction page 

### Recommendations to make from the portfolio review session:
* Intro/landing page - reduce the size of my nav bar - too much padding
* Intro/landing page - specify what area of software development I want to work in
* Intro/landing page - make the image a circle instead of an oval
* Intro/landing page - text is slightly off centre
* Projects & Contact page - when you hover on the buttons, the button text only changes when you hover on the text, but not the button itself
* Projects - loopd project - 'together' is spelt incorrectly 
* Review mobile-responsiveness - the nav bar cuts out on an android, but is fine on an iPhone...
* Note somewhere on the website that the portfolio is made with accessibility in mind
